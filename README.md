# Save the Bunny

Welcome to "Save the Bunny" project repository!  My 1st Unity project for mobile. This is a simple mobile game developed using Unity and C# where the player's goal is to save the falling girl and earn high scores.

## Gameplay

In "Save the Bunny", players control a character who must rescue falling bunnies by catching them before they hit the ground. Each saved bunny earns the player points, while missing a bunny results in a score penalty. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the speed of falling bunnies increases over time.

## Features

- Intuitive touch controls for easy gameplay on mobile devices.
- Score tracking to challenge players to beat their own high scores.
